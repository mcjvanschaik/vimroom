Vimroom
=======

This is my personal fork of [Vimroom by Mike West](https://github.com/mikewest/vimroom). 

Please check out Mike West's repository for Vimroom. His configuration has
worked well for me, but I have decided to create my own fork and keep my
personal customisations in it.

## What have I done?

Vimroom sets the current buffer with regular plain VIM-functions. This makes
it more convenient for writing. It centralises the active buffer and strips
off most distractions from the screen. It especially works well in a full
screen terminal, but I don't have a full screen terminal for Windows. Instead I
strip off as much of the remaining visible items from my GVIM.

I also set some settings for plain text authoring that I like.

### Customizations

- Remove GUIoptions to get rid of menu's, scrollbars and toolbar
- If available set Autosave 

## Get plugins

*Vimroom* is available in several locations. You can get the plugin from:

- the [creator's website](http://projects.mikewest.org/vimroom/)
- [github.com](https://github.com/mikewest/vimroom)
- [vim.org](http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=3766)

The *Autosave* plugin by Alexey Chernenkov saves the file automatically. I
like that when I am writing on longer pieces of text. You can get this plugin
from:

- [github.com](https://github.com/907th/vim-auto-save)
- [vim.org](http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=4521)

I also like to use a Chrome extension for Markdownfiles called [MarkDown
Preview Plus](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/febilkbfcbhebfnokafefeacimjdckgl).
This extension can convert a markdown-file in the browser and has a
auto-reload function. This makes it very easy to get a preview of my file
while writing it with the auto-save on.
